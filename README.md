What problem does it solve?  
What application does?
Why you used the technologies you used?



## Getting started 🚀 
Use [this tool](https://githubnext.com/projects/repo-visualization/) to explore the project if it is large

##  Development 🐙
- There are TODO comments in the code.
- Install git hooks. Run this command `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

### Branching strategy
- [CI / Trunk Based Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4Ijkq6Myfc) - only `main` branch. Good when you are just starting up, need to iterate quickly or you work mostly with senior developers.

#### Semantic Rleases
Releases must follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/lang/uk/)  
Follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to bump the version. [READ THIS SUMMARY](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

- Following this convention, automation will create release and pre-release tags automatically.
- Following this convention, automation will generate `CHANGELOG.md`  automatically.
- [semver comparsion operators](https://github.com/Masterminds/semver)
- To trigger a new release without actually making any changes, run `git commit --allow-empty -m "fix: trigger release with empty commit" && git push`
